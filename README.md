# ColorSensing
This project aims to detect object colors based on light reflection density using photoresistor (LDR). Using RGB color system we get the red color density by reading the sensor (LDR) after lighting just red color on the object so it’ll reflect to the sensor, and the same principle applied to the other colors green and blue. if we have red, green and blue color densities with that we can produce the same color of the object after some processing. For more accurate colors we’ll be reading the sensor more than one time for each color and then calculate the average of them.
